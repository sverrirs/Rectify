This can cause the file to be misplaced in your photo library. \r\n\r\nAs an example a photo from January 21, 2016 might end up in your November 3, 2001 folder.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\nDownload the application from the <a href=\"https://github.com/sverrirs/Rectify/releases\">releases section</a>. \r\n\r\nThe application is just a single Executable (.exe) that you can immediately launch after downloading.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverrirs/Rectify/master/Docs/v2.0/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Rectify's main screen\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n# Disclaimers\r\nProject icon courtesy of http://www.flaticon.com/packs/essential-element-set\r\n\r\n<link href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverrirs/Rectify/master/RectifyUI/images/light-bulb-512.png' rel='image_src'/>\r\n<meta content='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverrirs/Rectify/master/RectifyUI/images/light-bulb-512.png' property='og:image'/>\r\n<meta content='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverrirs/Rectify/master/RectifyUI/images/light-bulb-512.png' name='twitter:image:src'/>",
