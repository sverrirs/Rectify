# Rectify
Rectify is a Windows application that can automatically identify and correct image and video files that have had their shooting dates incorrectly identified during import and have consequently been misplaced in your computer photo library.

Sometimes applications such as Google Picasa can incorrectly identify the shooting date on a image or video during import. This can cause the file to be misplaced in your photo library. 

As an example a photo from January 21, 2016 might end up in your November 3, 2001 folder.
