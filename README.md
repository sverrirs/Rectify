# Rectify
Rectify is a Windows application that can automatically fix erroneous image and video imports from cameras and mobile devices. 

Sometimes applications such as Google Picasa can incorrectly identify the shooting date on a image or video during import. This can cause the file to be misplaced in your photo library. 

As an example a photo from January 21, 2016 might end up in your November 3, 2001 folder.

# Install
Download the application from the <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/Rectify/releases">releases section</a>. 

The application is just a single Executable (.exe) that you can immediately launch after downloading.
